# Enable support for tracing coroutines, fibers and similar such asynchrony primitives. Corresponds
# to the `TRACY_FIBERS` define.

# disabled.

# Enable capture of the context switch data. The `TRACY_NO_CONTEXT_SWITCH` define is set if this

# Enable external sampling of the call stacks. The `TRACY_NO_SAMPLING` define is set if this

# Enable transfer of the machine code to the profiler. The `TRACY_NO_CODE_TRANSFER` define is set

# Listen for profilers on the localhost interface only. Corresponds to the `TRACY_ONLY_LOCALHOST`

# Enable on-demand mode. Traces are only collected when a server connects to the client.
# Also makes it possible to repeatedly re-connect to a client.
